# qa_tester
1. My favorite testing framework is the data-driven framework. I prefer a data-driven framework because it is how I do most of my testing when I code. I will write numerous lines of tests implementing various different examples, all iterating on each other in an attempt to find a way to break my code so I can improve it. Data is at the heart of a lot of what I do, as I plan on majoring in data science and enjoy deriving outcomes from large data sets.
